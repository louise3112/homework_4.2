## Music Collection

You have been asked to create an app that will allow a music collector to manage their collection of CDs/records.

We have given you some starting files and some starting code, use the `console.py` file manually test and run your repository functions. 

> Remember you need to create the 'music_library' DB as that is what we are telling Psycopg2 to interact with. 

Using the `console.py` file they would like to be able to:

* Create and Save Artists
* Create and Save Albums
* Delete all Artists / Albums
* Find Artists/Albums by their ID (`select`)
* List All Artists/Albums (`select_all`)


Every artist should have a name, and each album should have a name/title, genre and artist.

## Further tasks

Additionally it would be nice to be able to:

* List all the albums by an artist
* Edit Artists/Albums
* Delete Artists/Albums

Remember to regularly git commit!
